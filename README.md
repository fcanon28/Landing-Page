# Landing-Page

This is my second project for The Odin Project. Honestly I am very proud of myself for achieving this since this is the neatest looking webpage I've seen. I am so thankful for TOP for guiding me through the foundations and hopefully I can complete the whole course and land myself a tech job.

For this project, I approached it through sections namely the header, information, quote, and footer. Of course first thing is to structure the HTML elements according to what contents I'll be needing. Afterwards, I style each content (per section) to the appropriate color, font-style, weight, etc. After I am happy with everything, I then arranged everything using flexbox. 

Through the flexboxÂ exercises in the previous lessons, I was able to master flexing. I did go through some *rampage* moments because I couldn't understand "where" to put the syntax. But once I was able to conceptualize the parent-children relationship and how CSS inherits properties, I am now condfident in my flexing skills.

Excited for the rest of my TOP journey!
